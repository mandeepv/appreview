# OPS_STATE — living register of external state

Code is trackable from git; **non-code state is not** (DB migrations applied, dashboard settings, secrets, App Store Connect config). This is the one place that records what is currently true *outside* the repo.

**Rules:**
- **Update the row whenever you touch the setting.** A stale "Last verified" is a prompt to re-check, NOT a guess.
- **`unverified` is the honest default.** Never invent a value. If you don't know, it stays `unverified` until the owner confirms it in a sitting.
- Dashboard screenshots (`docs/dashboard-snapshots/`) are this doc's attachments.
- AI review sessions verify claims against THIS doc instead of asking the owner.

| Supabase | last restore drill | **never** | unverified | — |
| Supabase | prod migrations applied through | **`20260710010000`** — `completed_sections` [SPEC-13] + `rls_update_with_check` [SPEC-FIX-04 R4] applied to prod 2026-07-11; `completed_sections` column verified present via prod REST (HTTP 200) | 2026-07-11 | `supabase migration list --linked` |
| Supabase | prod backup mechanism | pg_dump 17 direct (no Docker) via `scripts/backup-prod.sh`; needs `PROD_DB_URL` in gitignored `.env.prod` | 2026-07-11 | `scripts/backup-prod.sh` |
| Supabase | dev migration `add_onboarding_variant_columns` [SPEC-15 §4.4] | **DONE 2026-07-19** — `20260711000000_add_onboarding_variant_columns.sql` applied to dev (`onboarding_variant text`, `variant_b_answers jsonb` on `user_profiles`, nullable, RLS untouched); `src/types/supabase.ts` regenerated + committed (both columns typed), tsc clean. Prod still pending (row below) | 2026-07-19 | `supabase migration list --linked` (dev) |
| Supabase | prod migration `add_onboarding_variant_columns` [SPEC-15 §4.5] | **pending** — MUST be applied via `scripts/db-push-prod.sh` BEFORE the v1.3.0 binary goes live, or every variant-B onboarding save writes to missing columns and fails. Never `supabase link` to prod manually | unverified | `supabase migration list --linked` (prod) |
| Supabase | delete-account deployed version | **SPEC-FIX-06** (ES256/JWKS + HS256 dual-path) deployed to **BOTH dev + prod 2026-07-11**. Dev verified on-device (200, account deleted); prod verified reachable (401 on no-auth/tampered) | 2026-07-11 | Supabase → Edge Functions |
| Supabase | dev auth signing system | **asymmetric ES256** (new JWT Signing Keys) — JWKS advertises one ES256 key | 2026-07-11 | `/auth/v1/.well-known/jwks.json` |
| Supabase | prod auth signing system | **asymmetric ES256** (same as dev) — so prod delete-account needs NO JWT_SECRET (verifies via JWKS) | 2026-07-11 | prod `/auth/v1/.well-known/jwks.json` |
| Supabase | gateway `verify_jwt` | on (per `config.toml`); live-state unverified | unverified | `supabase/config.toml` + dashboard |

| Supabase | SPEC-16 launch/gate work (now in v1.3.0) | **no change required** — no migrations, no edge-function changes, no type regeneration. NOTE 2026-07-19: SPEC-16 (splash/loading) folded into **v1.3.0**, not a separate 1.4.0 | 2026-07-11 | — |
| Supabase | SPEC-17 onboarding UX system [SPEC-17 §4.3] (now in v1.3.0) | **no change required** — presentation/interaction only; onboarding answer values, saved payload, and `user_profiles` shape are all unchanged. No migrations, no type regeneration, no edge-function changes. NOTE 2026-07-19: folded into **v1.3.0** | 2026-07-11 | — |

## Superwall

| Area | Setting | Current value | Last verified | How to check |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Superwall | `subscription_gate` | Gated, 100%, audience = "unsubscribed users / no active entitlements", no match-limit — **re-verified in dashboard 2026-07-11** (SPEC-FIX-10 F8) | 2026-07-11 | Superwall dashboard → Placements |

| Superwall | dashboard-change habit | screenshot on every change (F5 pointer) | — | `docs/dashboard-snapshots/` |
| Superwall | SPEC-16 launch/gate work (now in v1.3.0) | **no change required** — gate logic untouched; do NOT modify `subscription_gate` placement/audience | 2026-07-11 | Superwall dashboard → Placements |
| Superwall | SPEC-17 onboarding UX system [SPEC-17 §4.5] (now in v1.3.0) | **no change required** — onboarding presentation only; the paywall/gate path is untouched | 2026-07-11 | Superwall dashboard → Placements |

## Sentry

| Sentry | SPEC-16 `expo-splash-screen` calls (now in v1.3.0) | **pending post-release check** — no config change; after **v1.3.0** ships confirm no new error class from `preventAutoHideAsync`/`hideAsync` (they're try/caught — a spike means the guard is being hit) | unverified | Sentry → Issues (env=prod, release 1.3.0) |
| Sentry | SPEC-17 onboarding UX system [SPEC-17 §4.4] | **no change required** — no error-path or config change | 2026-07-11 | — |

## PostHog

| Area | Setting | Current value | Last verified | How to check |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| PostHog | internal-user filter | not done | unverified | PostHog → Settings → Project |
| PostHog | dashboards | none yet (Appendix C, after v1.2.0) | unverified | PostHog → Dashboards |
| PostHog | person-deletion on account delete | not built (7.2 parked) | unverified | — |
| PostHog | `onboarding-flow` feature flag [SPEC-15 §4.1] | **CREATED 2026-07-19** — multivariate, key `onboarding-flow`, variants `control`/`variant_b`, 100% release condition, enabled. Currently **50/50 (TEST split)** so both A-with-fixes and B are reachable on the dev build. ⚠️ Single PostHog project (no separate dev/prod) — this same flag serves prod; **before v1.3.0 ships, set the launch split deliberately** (0% = ships dark, or the intended experiment split). variant_b→0% is the kill switch | 2026-07-19 | PostHog → Feature Flags → `onboarding-flow` |
| PostHog | `onboarding-flow` ramp to 50/50 [SPEC-15 §4.2] | **pending** — flip only after placeholder copy is replaced AND v1.3.0 is dominant. variant_b→0% is the kill switch (no build). Annotate at ramp start/stop | unverified | PostHog → Feature Flags |
| PostHog | onboarding A/B experiment dashboard [SPEC-15 §4.3] | **pending** — funnel `welcome_cta_tapped`→`onboarding_step_completed`→`auth_succeeded`→`paywall_presented`→`subscription_purchased` broken down by `onboarding_variant`, env=production; + `onboarding_variant_assigned` by `source` trend | unverified | PostHog → Dashboards |
| PostHog | launch-health events [SPEC-16 §4.1] (now in v1.3.0) | **optional/pending** — no flag needed. At **v1.3.0** release, optionally add `plan_theater_shown` (per-user; a repeat = returning-launch regression) + `gate_wait_exceeded` to a launch-health dashboard so the "theater exactly once per user" signal is watched | unverified | PostHog → Dashboards |
| PostHog | SPEC-17 flag-state check before merge [SPEC-17 §4.2] | **OBSOLETE 2026-07-19** — this row guarded against merging the onboarding-UX redesign mid-experiment. Moot now: SPEC-16+17 are folded into v1.3.0 and ship *together with* the experiment framework, before any ramp. There is no in-flight experiment to poison — A (control) and B both get the new UX from day one. No action | 2026-07-19 | — |
| PostHog | v1.3.0 ship annotation [SPEC-17 §4.1] | **pending** — on the day **v1.3.0** rolls out, add a prod annotation: "Onboarding UX system + A/B framework shipped (v1.3.0); both arms get the new UX". Funnel step names/semantics unchanged, but drop-off *levels* will move — the annotation lets any A/B readout span the release cleanly. Tick with the date when added | unverified | PostHog → Annotations (prod) |

## App Store Connect

| Area | Setting | Current value | Last verified | How to check |

## Accepted risks (owner decisions — revisit only on the stated trigger)

| Risk accepted | Decided | Compensating control / revisit trigger |
|---|---|---|
| EU analytics tracking without a consent gate | 2026-07-09 | Data already minimal (no PII, pseudonymous IDs, deletion path). Revisit at 5K MAU, first EU data-subject request, or any regulator/App-Review privacy contact |
| Prod DB password never rotated (leaked in old public git history) | 2026-07-09 | Apps use the anon key, not the DB password. Revisit if the repo history is ever shared again |
| No 2FA/recovery hardening on Apple ID & co. | 2026-07-09 | None — accepted as-is |
| No support playbook (tickets handled ad hoc) | 2026-07-09 | Revive if ticket volume appears |
| No mechanical merge-blocking on `main` (GitHub paywalls branch protection on private repos) | 2026-07-10 | The 4 blocking checks (+1 advisory `audit` job) run on every PR to main + "never merge on red" working rule. Revisit on a GitHub Team upgrade |
| CI runs on PRs + manual release gate only (not every push) | 2026-07-09 | Metered Actions minutes; local tsc/lint/test before merges; manual CI run is a release-checklist step |
| Offline first-v1.2.0-launch for a paying v1.1.0 user (SPEC-FIX-08) | 2026-07-11 | A paying v1.1.0 user whose FIRST v1.2.0 launch is offline has the legacy-unowned flag cleared (SPEC-FIX-08 migration) and sits at the retry/escape-hatch screen until connectivity returns. One launch wide, payers-only — inherent cost of the user-binding security fix. Revisit trigger: support tickets about it |
