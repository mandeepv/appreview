# OPS_STATE — living register of external state

Code is trackable from git; **non-code state is not** (DB migrations applied, dashboard settings, secrets, App Store Connect config). This is the one place that records what is currently true *outside* the repo.

**Rules:**
- **Update the row whenever you touch the setting.** A stale "Last verified" is a prompt to re-check, NOT a guess.
- **`unverified` is the honest default.** Never invent a value. If you don't know, it stays `unverified` until the owner confirms it in a sitting.
- Dashboard screenshots (`docs/dashboard-snapshots/`) are this doc's attachments.
- AI review sessions verify claims against THIS doc instead of asking the owner.

| Supabase | dev migration `add_onboarding_variant_columns` [SPEC-15 §4.4] | **pending** — `20260711000000_add_onboarding_variant_columns.sql` (adds `onboarding_variant text`, `variant_b_answers jsonb` to `user_profiles`, nullable, RLS untouched). Apply to dev (`supabase db push`) + regenerate `src/types/supabase.ts`, then tick with a date | unverified | `supabase migration list --linked` (dev) |
| Supabase | prod migration `add_onboarding_variant_columns` [SPEC-15 §4.5] | **pending** — MUST be applied via `scripts/db-push-prod.sh` BEFORE the v1.3.0 binary goes live, or every variant-B onboarding save writes to missing columns and fails. Never `supabase link` to prod manually | unverified | `supabase migration list --linked` (prod) |
| Supabase | delete-account deployed version | **SPEC-FIX-06** (ES256/JWKS + HS256 dual-path) deployed to **BOTH dev + prod 2026-07-11**. Dev verified on-device (200, account deleted); prod verified reachable (401 on no-auth/tampered) | 2026-07-11 | Supabase → Edge Functions |

| Supabase | prod auth signing system | **asymmetric ES256** (same as dev) — so prod delete-account needs NO JWT_SECRET (verifies via JWKS) | 2026-07-11 | prod `/auth/v1/.well-known/jwks.json` |
| Supabase | gateway `verify_jwt` | on (per `config.toml`); live-state unverified | unverified | `supabase/config.toml` + dashboard |
| Supabase | `JWT_SECRET` set | **dev: yes** (set 2026-07-11; now optional there — dev is ES256/JWKS) / prod: no | 2026-07-11 | `supabase secrets list` |

## Accepted risks (owner decisions — revisit only on the stated trigger)

| Risk accepted | Decided | Compensating control / revisit trigger |
|---|---|---|
| EU analytics tracking without a consent gate | 2026-07-09 | Data already minimal (no PII, pseudonymous IDs, deletion path). Revisit at 5K MAU, first EU data-subject request, or any regulator/App-Review privacy contact |
| Prod DB password never rotated (leaked in old public git history) | 2026-07-09 | Apps use the anon key, not the DB password. Revisit if the repo history is ever shared again |
| No 2FA/recovery hardening on Apple ID & co. | 2026-07-09 | None — accepted as-is |
| No support playbook (tickets handled ad hoc) | 2026-07-09 | Revive if ticket volume appears |
| No mechanical merge-blocking on `main` (GitHub paywalls branch protection on private repos) | 2026-07-10 | The 4 blocking checks (+1 advisory `audit` job) run on every PR to main + "never merge on red" working rule. Revisit on a GitHub Team upgrade |
| CI runs on PRs + manual release gate only (not every push) | 2026-07-09 | Metered Actions minutes; local tsc/lint/test before merges; manual CI run is a release-checklist step |
| Offline first-v1.2.0-launch for a paying v1.1.0 user (SPEC-FIX-08) | 2026-07-11 | A paying v1.1.0 user whose FIRST v1.2.0 launch is offline has the legacy-unowned flag cleared (SPEC-FIX-08 migration) and sits at the retry/escape-hatch screen until connectivity returns. One launch wide, payers-only — inherent cost of the user-binding security fix. Revisit trigger: support tickets about it |
